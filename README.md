## Project description
The project aims to analyze the "Colombia Housing Properties Price" dataset to understand the factors influencing property prices in Colombia. The dataset contains over 1,000,000 property listings with features such as price, location, and property size. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify key factors that drive property prices in Colombia, providing valuable insights for real estate investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Our analysis will involve exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building to predict property prices based on the dataset's features.

## Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of property prices and other key features.
2. Identify key factors that influence property prices in Colombia.
3. Develop predictive models to estimate property prices based on the dataset's features.
4. Evaluate the performance of the predictive models and identify areas for improvement.

## Project structure
The project will be structured as follows:
- Data collection: Download the dataset from Kaggle and load it into a Jupyter notebook.
- Data preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis: Analyze the distribution of property prices and other key features.
- Feature selection: Identify key factors that influence property prices in Colombia.
- Model building: Develop predictive models to estimate property prices based on the dataset's features.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the predictive models and identify areas for improvement.
- Documentation: Write a report summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis.
- Presentation: Prepare a presentation to share the results with stakeholders.
