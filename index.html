                    <p>
                        We chose the "Colombia Housing Properties Price" dataset for its relevance and extensive data,
                        featuring over 1,000,000 property listings. With varied features such as price, location, and
                        property size, it offers a comprehensive view of Colombia's real estate market. This dataset
                        allows us to understand key factors influencing property prices, crucial both economically and
                        socially. Its size ensures robust model training for accurate analyses, making it an exciting
                        opportunity to explore the complexities of Colombia's real estate market.

                <h3>Correlation Matrix</h3>
                <div class="content_graph content_graph_left">
                    <div class="graph">
                        <img src="Images/Grafica1.jpeg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="graph_text">
                        <p>
                            In this correlation matrix, the linear relationships between the variables in the dataset 
                            are revealed. A strong correlation is observed between "rooms", "bedrooms" and "bathrooms",
                            which is expected given their relationship with the number of rooms and bathrooms in a
                            property. The significant correlation of "bathrooms" with the price stands out, suggesting
                            that the number of bathrooms may be an influential factor in the value of the property.
                            The location variables, “lat” and “lon,” exhibit moderate correlations with other variables,
                            indicating a potential relationship between geographic location and property characteristics.
                            Furthermore, a moderate correlation is identified between "surface_total" and price, suggesting 
                            that the total size of the property can affect the value, although to a lesser extent than other
                            characteristics such as the number of bedrooms or bathrooms. This information provides valuable
                            insights to understand which aspects can most significantly influence the price of a property.

                <h3>Distribution of Numerical Variables</h3>
                <div class="content_graph content_graph_right">
                    <div class="graph_text">
                        <p>
                            Additionally, we graphically obtained the numerical distributions of the variables that have
                            a strong relationship with the price of housing. Here you can notice that they maintain a bias
                            to the right, this is due to the variety of atypical values that we can find in the dataset.
                            Additionally, from here we can get several ideas about our data, for example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For the bedrooms, the distribution reaches its maximum point between 3 and 5,
                                which tells us that these are going to be typical numbers in residences, but
                                at the same time there are atypical data such as 30 or 60 rooms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For bathrooms, it is also observed that the usual values range between 2 and 3
                                bathrooms per residence.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Regarding the surfaces, it can be seen that we have mostly residences with
                                surfaces less than 10,000m^2
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="graph">
                        <img src="Images/Grafica2.jpeg">

            <section class="square">

                    <h3>Our Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our hypothesis is that various property features, such as location, size, and amenities, are
                        correlated with their prices.
                        We aim to train a machine learning model on the "Colombia Housing Properties Price" dataset to
                        explore these correlations
                        and develop a predictive model capable of estimating property prices accurately.
                        This will enhance our understanding of the factors influencing property prices in Colombia.
