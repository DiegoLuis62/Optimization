                    <p>
                        The objective is to develop a regression model capable of predicting the
                        price of real estate properties in Colombia, based on various characteristics.
                        We will use a data set 
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julianusugaortiz/colombia-housing-properties-price" target="_blank">
                            Colombia Housing Properties Price
                        </a> that contains information about geographic location
                        (latitude and longitude), as well as physical attributes of the properties such
                        as the number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and the total area of ​​the property.
                        Our goal is to train a machine learning model that, given a set of input features,
                        can accurately estimate the price of a real estate property based on these
                        characteristics. This model will have practical applications in the real estate market,
                        providing buyers and sellers with a useful tool to evaluate the value of properties.

                        After carrying out different tests and comparisons, it was decided to use
                        a Random Forest regression model, this is a supervised learning algorithm
                        used for both regression and classification tasks. 
                        It is an ensemble technique that combines multiple decision trees during
                        training and produces a more robust and generalizable model. In this model,
                        the variables are used as input: 'lat', 'lon', 'rooms', 'bedrooms',
                        'bathrooms', 'surface_total' with the objective of estimating the variable
                        'price' that indicates the price of the property.<br>
                        <br>
                        After separating the data into training and testing, the RandomForest
                        implementation looks like this:

                                Number of Estimators (n_estimators): Specifies the number of
                                decision trees to be built in the forest. In this case, it was set
                                to 200 (which gave us a higher score), meaning that a total of 200
                                decision trees were built.

                                reproducible.

                    <h3>Validation methods and the Metrics employed</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Random Forest Regression model of the sckit-learn library has been
                        used to predict the variable 'Price'. The method used to validate the
                        model is the score() method which calculates the coefficient of
                        determination (R^2) as a measure of model performance. Internally, when
                        the score() method is called on a Random Forest regression model,
                        scikit-learn uses the model predictions to calculate the coefficient of
                        determination. This coefficient measures the proportion of the variance
                        of the target variable that is explained by the model. In other words,
                        it indicates how well the model predictions fit the actual data.

                    <h3>Preliminary Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is crucial to highlight that the selection of a model is only the
                        first step in a continuous process of refinement and improvement.
                        Improving model accuracy not only depends on the selection of the
                        appropriate algorithm but also on the quality and quantity of available
                        data, as well as feature engineering. Additionally, deep understanding of
                        the problem domain and constant iteration are critical to developing a
                        robust and reliable predictive model. In future research, it would be
                        valuable to explore feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model
                        ensemble techniques to further boost the predictive performance of the
                        Random Forest and ultimately provide more accurate and useful home price
                        estimates for stakeholders in the real estate sector in Colombia.<br>
                        <br>
                        After evaluating three different regression models to predict housing
                        prices in Colombia, we have determined that the Random Forest model has
                        proven to be the most promising according to our evaluation metric. The
                        selection of this model is based on its superior performance, with a score
                        of 0.7996, compared to the other models tested, namely Linear Regression and
                        Gradient Boosting Regressor, which scored 0.3752 and 0.7767 respectively.<br>
                        <br>
                        By looking at the spread of predicted data versus actual data, several
                        important patterns were identified. First, we note that the dispersion of the
                        data increases as prices increase, indicating that the model fails to accurately
                        predict higher-priced houses or apartments. However, most of the predicted data
                        points are close to the regression line, representing a perfect prediction where
                        the actual values are equal to the predicted values. In addition, there are points
                        that show significant imprecision and deviate substantially from the regression
                        line.<br>
                        <br>
                        Based on these observations, we conclude that although the Random Forest model
                        demonstrates strong performance, there are still areas to improve its accuracy.
                        These improvements can be achieved by acquiring more data available in our dataset
                        or by optimizing model attributes. Therefore, we have chosen the Random Forest model
                        as our initial model for this housing price prediction project in Colombia.<br>
