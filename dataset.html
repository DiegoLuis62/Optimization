                    <p>
                        The objective is to develop a regression model capable of predicting the
                        price of real estate properties in Colombia, based on various characteristics.
                        We will use a data set that contains information about geographic location
                        (latitude and longitude), as well as physical attributes of the properties such
                        as the number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and the total area of ​​the property.
                        Our goal is to train a machine learning model that, given a set of input features,
                        can accurately estimate the price of a real estate property based on these
                        characteristics. This model will have practical applications in the real estate market,
                        providing buyers and sellers with a useful tool to evaluate the value of properties.

                        After carrying out different tests and comparisons, it was decided to use
                        a Random Forest regression model, this is a supervised learning algorithm
                        used for both regression and classification tasks. 
                        It is an ensemble technique that combines multiple decision trees during
                        training and produces a more robust and generalizable model. In this model,
                        the variables are used as input: 'lat', 'lon', 'rooms', 'bedrooms',
                        'bathrooms', 'surface_total' with the objective of estimating the variable
                        'price' that indicates the price of the property.<br>
                        <br>
                        After separating the data into training and testing, the RandomForest
                        implementation looks like this:

                                Number of Estimators (n_estimators): Specifies the number of
                                decision trees to be built in the forest. In this case, it was set
                                to 200 (which gave us a higher score), meaning that a total of 200
                                decision trees were built.
                            </li>

                                Random State (random_state): This parameter is used to initialize
                                the internal random number generator, ensuring that the results are
                                reproducible.

                    <p>
                        The Random Forest Regression model of the sckit-learn library has been
                        used to predict the variable 'Price'. The method used to validate the
                        model is the score() method which calculates the coefficient of
                        determination (R^2) as a measure of model performance. Internally, when
                        the score() method is called on a Random Forest regression model,
                        scikit-learn uses the model predictions to calculate the coefficient of
                        determination. This coefficient measures the proportion of the variance
                        of the target variable that is explained by the model. In other words,
                        it indicates how well the model predictions fit the actual data.
