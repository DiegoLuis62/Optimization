                    <p>
                        The objective is to develop a regression model capable of predicting the
                        price of real estate properties in Colombia, based on various characteristics.
                        We will use a data set 
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julianusugaortiz/colombia-housing-properties-price" target="_blank">
                            Colombia Housing Properties Price</a> that contains information about geographic
                        location (latitude and longitude), as well as physical attributes of the properties such
                        as the number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and the total area of ​​the property.
                        Our goal is to train a machine learning model that, given a set of input features,
                        can accurately estimate the price of a real estate property based on these
                        characteristics. This model will have practical applications in the real estate market,
                        providing buyers and sellers with a useful tool to evaluate the value of properties.

                                After carrying out different tests and comparisons, it was decided to use
                                a Random Forest regression model, this is a supervised learning algorithm
                                used for both regression and classification tasks. 
                                It is an ensemble technique that combines multiple decision trees during
                                training and produces a more robust and generalizable model. In this model,
                                the variables are used as input: 'lat', 'lon', 'rooms', 'bedrooms',
                                'bathrooms', 'surface_total' with the objective of estimating the variable
                                'price' that indicates the price of the property.<br>
                                <br>
                                After separating the data into training and testing, the RandomForest
                                implementation looks like this:

                                        to 200 (which gave us a higher score), meaning that a total of 200

                            <p>
                                The Random Forest Regression model of the sckit-learn library has been
                                used to predict the variable 'Price'. The method used to validate the
                                model is the score() method which calculates the coefficient of
                                determination (R^2) as a measure of model performance. Internally, when
                                the score() method is called on a Random Forest regression model,
                                scikit-learn uses the model predictions to calculate the coefficient of
                                determination. This coefficient measures the proportion of the variance
                                of the target variable that is explained by the model. In other words,
                                it indicates how well the model predictions fit the actual data.

                            <h3>Preliminary Conclusions</h3>
                            <p>
                                It is crucial to highlight that the selection of a model is only the
                                first step in a continuous process of refinement and improvement.
                                Improving model accuracy not only depends on the selection of the
                                appropriate algorithm but also on the quality and quantity of available
                                data, as well as feature engineering. Additionally, deep understanding of
                                the problem domain and constant iteration are critical to developing a
                                robust and reliable predictive model. In future research, it would be
                                valuable to explore feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model
                                ensemble techniques to further boost the predictive performance of the
                                Random Forest and ultimately provide more accurate and useful home price
                                estimates for stakeholders in the real estate sector in Colombia.<br>
                                <br>
                                After evaluating three different regression models to predict housing
                                prices in Colombia, we have determined that the Random Forest model has
                                proven to be the most promising according to our evaluation metric. The
                                selection of this model is based on its superior performance, with a score
                                of 0.7996, compared to the other models tested, namely Linear Regression and
                                Gradient Boosting Regressor, which scored 0.3752 and 0.7767 respectively.<br>
                                <br>
                                By looking at the spread of predicted data versus actual data, several
                                important patterns were identified. First, we note that the dispersion of the
                                data increases as prices increase, indicating that the model fails to accurately
                                predict higher-priced houses or apartments. However, most of the predicted data
                                points are close to the regression line, representing a perfect prediction where
                                the actual values are equal to the predicted values. In addition, there are points
                                that show significant imprecision and deviate substantially from the regression
                                line.<br>
                                <br>
                                Based on these observations, we conclude that although the Random Forest model
                                demonstrates strong performance, there are still areas to improve its accuracy.
                                These improvements can be achieved by acquiring more data available in our dataset
                                or by optimizing model attributes. Therefore, we have chosen the Random Forest model
                                as our initial model for this housing price prediction project in Colombia.<br>

                            <p>
                                In this model we choose a regression neural network employed to predict house
                                prices based on various features. The choice of this approach lies in the
                                inherent ability of neural networks to learn complex relationships between input
                                features and the target variable, in this case, house price.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Details of the Neural Network Model:
                                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                    <li>
                                        Hidden Layers: The neural network consists of six hidden layers, each
                                        with 21 neurons. This deep structure effectively captures hierarchical and
                                        complex relationships among house features, which can be crucial for accurate
                                        price prediction.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Activation Function: The hyperbolic tangent activation function (tanh) is used.
                                        This non-linear function introduces the ability to capture and model non-linear
                                        relationships between input features and the target variable, thereby enhancing
                                        the model's ability to adapt to the complexity of the data.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Regularization: To prevent overfitting, regularization is applied. In this case,
                                        L2 regularization is used, which penalizes large weights in the network. This
                                        helps control the model's complexity and improve its ability to generalize to
                                        unseen data during training.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Training: The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which adjusts
                                        the network weights to minimize the loss function. During training, weights are
                                        iteratively updated using gradient descent, allowing the model to gradually learn
                                        to make more accurate predictions about house prices.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                Model Performance: <br>
                                The model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R^2). An
                                R^2 mean value of 0.7238940 after 100 iterations indicates that the model is able to
                                explain approximately 72.39% of the variability in house prices in the test dataset.

                                The Random Forest Regression model of the sckit-learn library has been
                                used to predict the variable 'Price'. The method used to validate the
                                model is the score() method which calculates the coefficient of
                                determination (R^2) as a measure of model performance. Internally, when
                                the score() method is called on a Random Forest regression model,
                                scikit-learn uses the model predictions to calculate the coefficient of
                                determination. This coefficient measures the proportion of the variance
                                of the target variable that is explained by the model. In other words,
                                it indicates how well the model predictions fit the actual data.

                            <h3>Preliminary Conclusions</h3>
                            <p>
                                Comparing the new machine learning model with the previous analysis
                                conducted on the "Colombia Housing Properties Price" dataset, several
                                preliminary conclusions can be drawn. The new model, based on a Multi-Layer
                                Perceptron Regressor (MLPRegressor), exhibits a moderate level of performance,
                                with an average R-squared score of approximately 0.726 across multiple iterations.
                                This indicates that the model can explain around 72.6% of the variance in
                                the housing prices, slightly higher than the performance observed in the
                                previous analysis. The features used in the new model, such as 'lat', 'lon',
                                'rooms', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'Casa', 'Apartamento', and 'surface_total',
                                align with the variables identified in the previous analysis as significantly
                                correlated with property prices. This consistency suggests that these features
                                indeed play crucial roles in determining housing prices in Colombia. The new model
                                introduces greater complexity through the use of multiple hidden layers and neurons,
                                potentially enabling it to capture nonlinear relationships within the dataset. While
                                the new model demonstrates promising performance, there are opportunities for further
                                enhancement through hyperparameter tuning and the exploration of alternative machine
                                learning algorithms to deepen insights into the determinants of housing prices in
                                Colombia. In summary, the preliminary analysis of the new model suggests that it
                                offers a valuable framework for predicting housing prices based on property features,
                                enhancing understanding of the factors influencing Colombia's real estate market.
                                Further refinement and validation of the model will be essential for achieving robust
                                and reliable predictions.
